## My process

I nested a wrapper container in the main tag and added an article tag inside that contianer. I then added all the page contents accordingly in the article container includiing a table for the nutrition content. I gave the wrapper container a fixed width, border radius and addedd a padding to replicate the design. I gave the image a smaller border radius, used a clamp function for a responsive font sizing and gave other required elements colors, padding and margins. I used the css ::maker psudo element to change the color of the bullet list icons. For the media query, I reduced the wrapper padding and made sure the featured image took the entire row ignoring the wrapper padding. I achieved this by giving the image a negative top, letft and right margin size of of the media query screen border and adding the total left and righ padding size to the original width. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to properly deal with images sizes in media queries and how to use the clamp function.

### Continued development

In the next project, I will be using new css properties I have seen peoople use to archieve responsive design. I'll also use css clamp more often in the next projects.
